    <h3>Unit 1 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>
        <p>Given that this is my first project I have definitely changed the way I have used the provided tools of Trello and Visual Studio Code from when I started. For example I have come to rely heavily on Trello to control where I am up too and what needs to be completed, using timed alarms and colour coding to show urgency. 
            I decided to use the cards to type up my answers, given that I can work from home or even via my phone and just add notes for myself through the day. 
            I have had to concentrate heavily on the coding side and by using sites like https://www.w3schools.com/ to give me information on how to tackle my problems, my use of VSC has become easier, I now tend to have the HTML and CSS pages open side by side and then copy and paste from Trello into my webpages.</p>

            <h3>Unit 1 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>
                <p>I can defiantly see the benefit of using Trello, I wish I had been aware of it in my previous roles where project management was relegated to a pen and paper or a physical whiteboard.
                    For somebody new to this environment I think it's a great starting point and the more I use it the more functions I began to find, the more lists I added, notes to myself, colour coding, setting out in the Kanban style and setting dates for task completion, its become second nature in a short period of time.
                    Using VSC I did have a little difficulty getting used to how the files work and interact with each other. However once I got the hang of it, its been great to see the effects my changes make and how the code interacts between HTML and CSS. I have watched my website come to life.</p>

            <h3>Unit 1 2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
                <p>I began my website with a particular theme in mind, a wanted a 1980's retro feel, reminiscent of the game arcades I grew up with, using buttons and backgrounds to highlight this with even a few sounds here and there. However my plans were just too ambitious given my level of skill, I had to investigate each action required and learn the code line by line. My first hurdle was the color scheme of that period and the graphics I had downloaded to use, despite looking great it was hard to highlight my text, I tried to use transparent backgrounds to highlight the paragraphs but it just became too busy, time was ticking and I decided I had used up enough on this.
                    I quickly established a new theme of sky and sky scenes, using clouds and a brighter colour scheme of blues, my favorite colour, which stood out much better, giving a cleaner friendly look to the site. I had already decided from the start that I wanted to use separate pages and link them together with a top navigation bar, this did present its own problems but I persevered and I am happy that I got it to work as desired. Overall I am happy with my first creation and I am looking forward to actually putting together my 80's style site to showcase some of my retro toy collection, watch this space.</p>

            <h3>Unit 1 2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
                <p>I think I would have liked to have been able to add a little more of my own personality into my first project site. For example using images that I had created myself, making a small introduction film to be added to the site, custom making some buttons and playing around with fonts and other visual effects. I have been investigating numerous personal websites on the internet and have gained a better insight into what makes an elegant but simple website that stands out.<p>

                <h3>Unit 1 2.5 Review outcomes to make sure match requirements and that they are fit for purpose</h3>
                        <p>I have read through all my outcomes and I am happy that they cover the requested topics and that I have answered the sections to the best of my current knowledge. I have detailed my answers researched from the internet with links to the source material, I have commented on my progress with my failures and my minor triumphs in building my website. I have also used my Trello board to control my progress and set deadlines. I would as previously mentioned make a number of  changes to my website but I am happy it is working and can be read clearly.
