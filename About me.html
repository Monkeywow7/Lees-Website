    <h3>My story so far...</h3>
    <p>I consider myself lucky to have been part of the generation that grew up alongside the onslaught and the rise of technology over the last 30 years, seeing significant changes in how we organize ourselves at work, deal with our daily lives and entertain ourselves in our own homes.
        I can still remember the first time I went to a games arcade, used the BBC Micro at school or waiting patiently in my bedroom with wide eyes as my Commodore 64 loaded up the lastest side scroller. 
        My interest in this field was cemented.
        <br>
        I spent the early part of my career in the logistics industry which was revolutionized by the ease in which route planning and database programmes were implemented into our daily working routines. 
        Despite being the end user in this situation I was able to work closely with our in-house developer and gain knowledge of what was possible and how to apply the developing systems in a practical and purposeful way.
        I continued onwards and became more involved in the hardware and production side of the Industry, with a slice of sales and customer service for good measure.
        Hands on repair and construction allowed me to merge my software knowledge and tracking faults down became an enjoyable cat & mouse game..
        And now Iâ€™ve come full circle, back to where it all began and I get to consider the foundations of everything IT...coding.</pr>
