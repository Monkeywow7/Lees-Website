    <h3>Unit 1 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
    <P>Having now gained experience of the benefit of Trello during my first project and the how to use it efficiently I have improved upon it's usage, by using a simple colour scheme for visual aid and setting it out in the Kanban style as explained, coupled with timed cards to prioritize tasks. This software could be used easily in teams as it was in my first project where tasks can be assigned to individuals where we all have access and can see how the project is developing. I have now gained knowledge of git and github which could be employed with greater emphasis on teamwork and collaboration with the code whilst still maintaining the integrity of the basic program.

    <h3>Unit 1 3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h3>
    <P>During the project and with some research I have concluded a number of ways that productivity and efficiency could have been improved or maintained.
        Keeping goals achievable, one large project even with a reasonable deadline can be overwhelming, breaking the project down into smaller iterations shows clear progress and motivates you as move toward the final product, Trello has really helped me achieve this over the final stages of this project.
        Prioritize, describe the top two or three high priority tasks you need to complete, in my project it has been the written content, focus on these and then estimate the time you should devote to these tasks. Set yourself deadlines and keep to them,</p>

    <h3>Unit 1 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
    <P>I think on my next project I would complete the work in sections, ie I would have completed my written content for the site first, having the content complete so I could then decide on my layout and theme of the site based on the content. I would employ a tool like Trello to maintain control of where I am up to and which tasks need completing in which order. first. I may employ a program like draw.io to layout my site design and how the pages would interact with each other. Despite this being a solo project I have had numerous conversations with other members of the class on Slack, it was employed heavily in my first project and those connections have been maintained.</p>

    <h3>Unit 1 3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
     <P>Software testing can be a lengthy process and can be broken down into various levels. The first level is during the development phase when it is tested for functionality. The second level is integrity testing where the independent software is tested in the context of other software that will interact with the software being tested. The third level is the complete integration stage where the software is ready and is tested by real life users. An extension of this could be a fourth stage of testing where the focus is on user experience rather than functionality.</p>
