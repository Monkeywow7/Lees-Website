        <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h3>
            <p>Today it’s hard to imagine any company existing without utilizing available modern technology, the applications are almost endless, but I will try to touch on some here. 
            Given my own experience I have seen the implementation of Inventory and stock control systems that have allowed companies to run much more efficiently. 
            Tracking usage and despatch of items, coupled with scanning technology and links to point of sale can make replenishment a closed loop, giving companies live up to date information in ever changing markets.
            This above usage can also be transferred to the storing of Data and use of customer information, accounts and marketing solutions. 
            As previously mentioned I was able to witness the changes IT brought to modern business first hand, personally one of the most significant has been the strides in communication. 
            The earliest of these being Email has changed the way we all work, contact and response with employees and clients has become instant, the world has become much smaller with geography no longer a factor. And now companies are able to make contact using live chat, video conferencing and a litinary of communication applications utilizing smart phones.

        <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3>
            <p>Digital projects can be uniquely tackled as they are malleable by their nature and can be easily altered, adjusted and improved. 
                        Utilizing agile project management principles collaboration can greatly assist in gaining the best results and making a digital project successful in its execution. 
                        The principles of agile working practices builds on digesting projects into manageable chucks, allowing greater focus and clarity. 
                        Other skills and resources that can aid in effectively delivering a digital project include: effective communication, building trust, reviewing and reflecting. 
                         In my current project I have utilized Trello as my main management tool allowing to work quickly and efficiently.

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h3>
            <P>Given what I have learned over the last few weeks, my first task has been to set up my Trello board, I have structured it based around the question and answer sections. 
                            This will help me to control the content of my site and edit quickly where required. I have laid it out using the Kanban style as in the previous project, a simple system of color coding and moving the cards to the final completed list. 
                            I have also included cards for graphics and style choices, updating with my own thoughts and comments as they become available.
            </p>

        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
            <p>Digital projects with all the benefits previously mentioned are not without their own risks, that could if not managed correctly impact on the success and outcome of the project. This can include fixed plans that don't allow for change, long term projects need to keep updated using agile iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks, digital projects should be flexible enough to represent the changes of the business or market represented.
                                    Misalignment with business processes or functionality can lead to failure if the practical application of the project is ignored. For example a website created solely with digital staff working on it without the input of anyone with any process knowledge of that business may produce a site that works well for the front end user but creates problems for back-end operational process and is ultimately a failure.
                                    Over ambition, something I experienced on my first Python game project, realistic goals given the available software tools, staffing, time scale and keeping to the original scope of the project is paramount to success, striving for perfection and deviating from established methods can ultimately lead to failure.</p>

        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
                <p>In selecting IT software and systems for a project it is important to first understand the overall requirements of the project, the why and the what the project is required for. Producing a family website for personal use or building an application to work within a business sound very different but could employ similar approaches if broken down into the following, quality, scope, deadline and budget. 
                    For example I could in a relative small amount of time produce a basic HTML site for personal/family use, costing me little with limited functionality but giving me the desired results within my original scope. 
                    Using the same mantra I could approach developing an application for a business, however this would call for me to discuss scope with the customer, set a realistic timeline for the development, establish budget and thus required team levels to complete within deadline, and employ project management software such as Trello to manage the team and update the client with progress. Each project tackled would need a different approach and if the priority of quality, scope, deadline and budget is changed the need to adapt and select relevant systems to achieve the goal will be required.

        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.– How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3>            
                <p>I have thoroughly enjoyed my first experience of Trello and I wish I could have employed it's usage in my previous job role. 
                    It has allowed me to keep control of how my project is progressing and to utilize the functions of the software to work for me. 
                    I have been using the cards to update my answers, leave myself notes, links to reference sources and set times for card completion. 
                    I have been using a simple traffic light colour scheme to give myself a visual indicator of where each task is up to and I have gained satisfaction when it's moved into that final completed column. 
                    It has also allowed me work quickly and efficiently on multiple tasks at the same time, changing between my cards with a click. 
                    I can then easily copy and paste my completed cards across to my HTML and CSS pages in Visual to create my website.

                    Git is a VCS, "version control system", it can be used on virtual projects to keep track of changes and create a historical record of those changes automatically.
                    I have not employed it's usage for my particular project but I can now see it's importance and would look to use it in the future. 
                    For a software developer it would be invaluable to be able to revert back to the original basic program you started with after making any changes or experimenting. 
                    This tool could be employed to fault find if those changes had unexpected outcomes meaning you can be creative without fear of irreversibly destroying the original code. My research has also explained that it allows multiple developers to work independently on the same project without disturbing each others files, making collaboration much easier. Using Git in conjunction with Github allows developers to discuss their projects, share their code and offer assistance in a social network setting, it can also be a place to get noticed by potential employers.</p>

                <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
                        <p>GDPR or the General Data Protection Regulation is a European directive that came into effect from May 2018, it was established so individuals could have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected.
                            According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address. The regulation does not make any distinction between personal data about individuals in their private, public or work roles – the person is the person.
                            When working on a digital project that handles private data it is ideal to produce a DPIA or Data Privacy Impact Assessment, this will assess the scope, context and purpose of the data required, whether it’s necessary to process the data and what compliance measures there are or will be in place. It can also establish if there are any risks to individuals data and the measures you can take to mitigate those risks.
                            If your project has any risk of exposing individuals data in any of these areas, then the fines for lack of compliance are huge, which is why they should be taken into consideration and data protection should be established from the start.</p>
