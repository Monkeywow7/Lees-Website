        <h3>Unit 2 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
        <P>I have laid out my website with a front page including a small introduction and the purpose of my site. I have then used a top navigation bar to link to the other separate pages. 
            I have built the pages as follows, Front cover, My story, Unit 1 Outcome 1, Unit 1 Outcome 2, Unit 1 Outcome 3 and Unit 2 Outcome 1. I have included hyperlinks under each of the relevant paragraphs for source material and then a final reference at the back of the site. The paragraphs are separated on to their own transparent background to highlight the text. I have used a bright and friendly blue sky theme throughout the site.
        </p>

        <h3>Unit 2 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
            <P>Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way to deal with this is to first get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.</p>

        <h3>Unit 2 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>
            <P>I would want to make my new website accessible to all, including people who would need mechanisms in place to browse my pages as easily as anybody else. People who may have a physical difficulty or be partial sighted or blind, people who may be hearing impaired or deaf.
                Developers have attempted to tackle this challenge and the following tools can be employed to make sure nobody misses out on what you have to say.
                For people who have a physical difficulty and cannot use a mouse or keyboard sites can be designed to use voice activated software for example Google Voice Search or similar software utilized by Amazons Alexa device to navigate the website.
                This type of voice activated software can also be helpful to people who are blind or visually impaired, employing other tools such as making allowances for Enlarged Text, using contrast and colours that make your site visible and easy to see and the use of keyboard shortcuts to aid navigation.
                For people with hearing impairment or who are deaf, descriptive tags can be added to your site giving more information or subtitles added to movies and sound files. These technologies are unfortunately only supported by a small percentage of the internet and with this subject being close to my heart I would look to employ their use in any future projects.</p>

        <h3>Unit 2 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
            <P>Websites can utilize a whole host of different file types to achieve their goals and these file types will be found all around the internet. I have attempted to describe a few of them and there uses here. With languages like .HTML/HTM and .CSS used to create the code to construct the site. Images can be added to the site using .JPEG, .JPG .PNG. and .GIF. Movie files can also be present using .MPG/ .MPEG, .MOV/ .QT, .AVI. Music or sound files come in the form of .MID/ .MIDI, .MP3 , MP4, and .WAV. Document files like .PDF. Text files like .TXT or .DOC. And files that compress data such as .RAR or .ZIP. The ever changing internet will probably have added a few more but these file types have been a constant for many years.</p>
